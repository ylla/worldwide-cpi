# Worldwide Consumer Price Index
The intent of this application is to build a CPI converter for worldwide use, where comparisons on CPI can be made between different nations.

# Consumer Price Index (according to Wikipedia)
A consumer price index (CPI) measures changes in the price level of a market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households.

## Measure of inflation
The CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically. Sub-indexes and sub-sub-indexes are computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services, being combined to produce the overall index with weights reflecting their shares in the total of the consumer expenditures covered by the index. It is one of several price indices calculated by most national statistical agencies. The annual percentage change in a CPI is used as a measure of inflation. A CPI can be used to index (i.e., adjust for the effect of inflation) the real value of wages, salaries, pensions, for regulating prices and for deflating monetary magnitudes to show changes in real values. 


It's a work in progress.
